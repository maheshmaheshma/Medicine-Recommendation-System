# 💊 Medicine Recommendation System

A web-based Machine Learning application that recommends appropriate medicines based on user-input symptoms. Built using Flask and trained with Scikit-learn, this system allows users to receive fast, automated suggestions in a user-friendly interface.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is designed to simulate a basic medicine suggestion tool. It allows users to input symptoms, processes the data using a trained model, and returns the most likely medicine recommendation based on the inputs.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔬 ML-based medicine prediction
- 🧾 Clean and simple HTML interface
- 📦 Trained model loading with Joblib
- 💻 Flask-powered backend
- ☁️ Deployable on platforms like Render
